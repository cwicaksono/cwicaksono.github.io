title: All About Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA for Android Development
---

I started Eclipse for create mobile application, I use it to create BlackBerry and Android mobile application. To create BlackBerry application on the first time there was 2 editor that we can use, first BlackBerry JDE and Eclipse. If we compare about that i think Eclipse will be a winner, i just found one advantages for using Eclipse than BlackBerry JDE.

When you create mobile application there a condition that you must refactor your code, there some reason from to make our code more clear and change our code more pretty or easy to maintain with team. BlackBerry JDE doesn't have refactor function, when we want to do refactor we must edit code by line manually. On Eclipse we can found and use refactor function.

But i think Eclipse have disadvantages like memory consumption and it's major issue when we use computer with minimal specification. Eclipse will use more memory consumption when we use it for create big mobile application, when you try it on Hello World you will not found this. And other disadvantages is there are much that shown on basic IDE even when you don't need that (and i know that we can hide them manually).

And now i found IntelliJ IDEA, i think it can be an alternative for Eclipse that more light weight, clean. When i try to use it today for create Android application, there are trouble that i found when i import my project but Google can help me about that. I use IntelliJ IDEA for 3 hours but i think will use it to replace Eclipse (but i still have Eclipse as backup plan if IntelliJ IDEA can provide my needs when create mobile application).
