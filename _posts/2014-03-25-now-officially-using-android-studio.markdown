title: Now Officially Using Android Studio
---
After a few days doing research about Android Studio and now decide to use it for my development tools. Based on my previous post about [comparison between Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA](http://cwicaksono.net/all-about-eclipse-and-intellij-idea-for-android-development/) that tell if IntelliJ is better than Eclipse.

We know that Android Studio is based on IntelliJ IDEA, and it's mean that advantages about IntelliJ is owned by Android Studio to. But on my research about using Android Studio i have many experience that almost make my mind to forget about it (Android Studio).

First using Android Studio it is really painfull because by default a development tools to build any application will provide clean source code. But on my experience (because i don't have any experience before) i read a few links that explain about my problem and nothing works. I remember that i have a friend (we are one team for several years when he still in the college) and i ask to him about my problem. Than he start guide me very well and after 2 hours chat with him i can solve my problem.

My problem is i missing several line of codes that use for check Maven Repository, after i add it i success to try Android Studio.
