Actually dependency manager is already for long time, but i have never used it for some reason. But a few months ago i challenge my self to use dependency manager.

Dependency manager is mechanisme that will download necessary dependency library that will be used on development process.

Here are some example of dependency manager

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for PHP
2. [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/)
3. [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) for iOS Development

If you want to try use dependency manager better use Linux or Mac.
